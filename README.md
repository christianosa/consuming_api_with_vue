# consuming_api_with_vue

## What is this?
This project was created during my class about how to consume REST API in using Vue.js (frontend).

## Introduction 
This project is a sample created to memorize topics from a great online course I attended. It was an interesting sample that I would like to share.
This sample show how to create an interface (frontend) using Vue, Axios and Bulma to access a public API - Pokemon https://pokeapi.co/ and show the result.
